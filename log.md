### Day 1: December 06, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Practice Jest and start learning about Pytest.

**Thoughts:** About pytest though, gave it a quick look to see how it works and it was quite easy to understand the basics. Really like it so looking forward to keeping learning about it. Also, perform some exercises of Python to refresh some concepts.

### Day 2: December 07, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Enter to the 4Geeks Christmas challenge and practice CSS.

**Thoughts:** Enter the challenge of making one Christmas Postcard, a timer and a gift list from 4Geeks Academy. Practice with some media queries in Css and use the platform of CSS Battle.

## Day 4: December 09, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Start making the Christmas Postcard for the 4Geeks challenge and practice main hooks of React.

**Thoughts:** Started with practicing main hooks of React (more of a quick look through them again). Use the knowledge practiced to start making the first part of the challenge of 4Geeks Academy.
